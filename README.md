## #Activist

*As the year comes to a close, I look back and think about everything that came with it. Not a week went by that something didn't blow up in the sphere of political social media: be it a school or police shooting, a nationalist rally, or even a tweet from the President himself. Twitter and Facebook are inundated with hashtags of people speaking for or against the issues they feel are important. But are these movements popping up each day, efforts not limited to but certainly driven by digital social platforms, actually leading to outcomes?*

### Digital Activism

Social Activism has been around as long as society, but its form has changed more radically in the past ten years than ever before. The protests, marches, and rallies have by no means gone away, but increasingly the organization and discussion of these events and issues has moved from the real world public to the digital public. In the past five years alone, tens if not *hundreds* of movements have started based on a hashtag, with supporters using the hashtag in their social media posts to show their support. Most if not all of the newer movements with significant name recognition leave predominantly digital footprints in their wake. But name recognition is not the same as translating efforts to outcomes. 

Noteworthy examples of social activism movements in recent years include the **Arab Spring**, the **#BlackLivesMatter** movement, and, most recently, the **#MeToo** movement.

#### The Arab Spring

The [Arab Spring](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/arab-spring) is a name given to a series of pro-Democracy protests in several countries in North Africa and the Middle-East, starting in December of 2010 but gaining most momentum in the Spring of 2011. While the protesting was in no way limited to social media, the people in these nations used these platforms to give voice and anonymity to themselves, when openly speaking out about many of these authoritarian institutions would risk life or limb. Additionally, the prominence of protest on the internet allowed the stories of the people living there to travel around the world, to those in other countries (near and far), who otherwise would likely not have been exposed to them.

At the time, it seemed like the protests had been wildly successful, with large-scale regime changes and international visibility. Yet, in many of these countries, the problems being protested against at the time have yet to be truly solved, and similar authoritarian regimes have assumed control in the years since.
