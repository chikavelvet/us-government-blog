*As the year comes to a close, I look back and think about everything that came with it. Not a week went by that something didn't blow up in the sphere of political social media: be it a school or police shooting, a nationalist rally, or even a tweet from the President himself. Twitter and Facebook are inundated with hashtags of people speaking for or against the issues they feel are important. But are these movements popping up each day, efforts not limited to but certainly driven by digital social platforms, actually leading to outcomes?*
