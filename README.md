## #Activist

*As the year comes to a close, I look back and think about everything that came with it. Not a week went by that something didn't blow up in the sphere of political social media: be it a school or police shooting, a nationalist rally, or even a tweet from the President himself. Twitter and Facebook are inundated with hashtags of people speaking for or against the issues they feel are important. But are these movements popping up each day, efforts not limited to but certainly driven by digital social platforms, actually leading to outcomes?*

### Digital Activism

Social Activism has been around as long as society, but its form has changed more radically in the past ten years than ever before. The protests, marches, and rallies have by no means gone away, but increasingly the organization and discussion of these events and issues has moved from the real world public to the digital public. In the past five years alone, tens if not *hundreds* of movements have started based on a hashtag, with supporters using the hashtag in their social media posts to show their support. Most if not all of the newer movements with significant name recognition leave predominantly digital footprints in their wake. But name recognition is not the same as translating efforts to outcomes. 

Noteworthy examples of social activism movements in recent years include the **Arab Spring**, the **#BlackLivesMatter** movement, and, most recently, the **#MeToo** movement.

#### The Arab Spring

The [Arab Spring](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/arab-spring) is a name given to a series of pro-Democracy protests in several countries in North Africa and the Middle-East, starting in December of 2010 but gaining most momentum in the Spring of 2011. While the protesting was in no way limited to social media, the people in these nations used these platforms to give voice and anonymity to themselves, when openly speaking out about many of these authoritarian institutions would risk life or limb. Additionally, the prominence of protest on the internet allowed the stories of the people living there to travel around the world, to those in other countries (near and far), who otherwise would likely not have been exposed to them.

At the time, it seemed like the protests had been wildly successful, with large-scale regime changes and international visibility. Yet, in many of these countries, the problems being protested against at the time have yet to be truly solved, and similar authoritarian regimes have assumed control in the years since.

#### #BlackLivesMatter

The [#BlackLivesMatter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) movement is a civil rights movement that focuses on eliminating the unequal treatment of Black Americans in the form of violence by police officers or vigilantes. The movement started in 2013, in response to the [shooting of Trayvon Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin), an incident in which an unarmed 17 year old black male was fatally shot, and the subsequent social outcry it caused. The movement has grown since then, propelled by similar cases of high visibility (notably the shootings of [Alton Sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Alton_Sterling) and [Philando Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile)).

The movement has been noted for it's use of a hashtag (coined originally in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, pictured above) as both a name, slogan, and symbol of support on social media. It has been described as "not your grandfather's civil rights movement", referring to its strong usage of technology and social media, and the prevalence of tech-savvy youth within its base. Alongside internet-based protest, the group organizes rallies and marches that see high attendence.

The group has seen much publicity, with both considerable support and criticism, including related reaction movements, **#BlueLivesMatter** and **#AllLivesMatter**.

#### #MeToo

Similar to #BlackLivesMatter, [#MeToo](https://metoomvmt.org/) is a so-called "hashtag" movement, based around a hashtag. #MeToo focuses on eliminating the high levels of sexual assault and rape experienced by women in America, helping survivors cope with their traumatic experiences, and bringing light to the inadequate way in which the justice system handles cases of sexual assault.

#MeToo has been responsible for several high-profile outings of sexual predators within Hollywood in particular, notably [Harvey Weinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_allegations) and [Kevin Spacey](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/09/kevin-spacey-accused-of-sexual-battery-by-massage-therapist).

### Role of Social Media in Activism

These movements are less than five years old, so what kind of outcome they have on society is yet to be determined. However, many scholars have debated what the role in general of social media in activism is, and whether it is beneficial or detrimental. In particular, NYU professor **Clay Shirky** and Belarusan scholar **Evgenyi Morozov** have a lot to say, and little to agree on.

#### Social Media as a Tool for Collective Action

Clay Shirky believes that social media provides "new tools enabling new forms of group formation."[^tweets] It just makes things easier: less cost, fewer obstacles, and more efficient communication. Whereas before, finding like-minded individuals willing to be activists with you would be difficult if not impossible, especially without significant time and money investments, now finding people is as easy as a search bar.

According to him, social media allows people to know more, to be more politically aware and conscious, than in the past, and it enables people to use that new consciousness to enact collective action. 

#### Slacktivism

Evgenyi Morozov, on the other hand, believe the digitalization of social activism has the serious risk of leading to what he and others call "slacktivism".

> For Morozov,  slacktivism is 'feel good activism that has zero political or social impact' but creates 'an illusion of having a meaningful impact on the world without demanding anything more than joining a Facebook group'.[^tweets]

In line with this, others have criticized how sensationalized the hashtag movements can be: a big incident might bring the movement back into popular discourse, but the public might quickly lose interest in the movement after a few weeks with no serious incidents.

#### Demographic Differences

Others have argued that the role of social media might be different in different demographics. For people with fewer resources, social media might provide a platform where no other platform is accessible, either due to monetary or time constraints. In addition, in countries where there is strict authoritarian rule and denial of freedom of speech, social media can similarly provide a safe platform to express anti-establishment political views without the fear associated with traditional displays of protest.[^middle]

### How People View Social Media and Activism

A [Pew Research Center study](http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/07/11/activism-in-the-social-media-age/) was conducted this year that analyzed public tweets and other data, and combined that with a survey of approximately 5000 Americans from diverse backgrounds, to determine how people in America view social media and its effect (positive or negative) on social activism.

One finding of the study is that roughly half of Americans reported that they have engaged in some form of political or social activity on social media within the past year, be it through group formation or collective action, encouraging others to action, researching local protests, or using a hashtag in support of a movement.

However, even given that, most Americans aren't sure how effective social media is for this purpose. Though 64% of Americans reported that they feel social media helps give underrepresented groups a voice, more than three of every four believe that social media distracts from the issues that are important, and as much as 71% agree with the idea of "slacktivism": that social media "makes people believe they're making a difference when they really aren't."

Ultimately, it's both. Social media is too big and varied to paint it in broad strokes: many people can use platforms like Facebook and Twitter to connect with each other, find like-minded activists, and to organize protests and rallies, while many others might not be investing (and might not have) the time and energy required to make any kind of difference. Either way, there aren't any signs that social activism will be returning completely to the ways of the past, so good or bad, the impact of social media will be felt.
