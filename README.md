## #Activist

*As the year comes to a close, I look back and think about everything that came with it. Not a week went by that something didn't blow up in the sphere of political social media: be it a school or police shooting, a nationalist rally, or even a tweet from the President himself. Twitter and Facebook are inundated with hashtags of people speaking for or against the issues they feel are important. But are these movements popping up each day, efforts not limited to but certainly driven by digital social platforms, actually leading to outcomes?*

### Digital Activism

Social Activism has been around as long as society, but its form has changed more radically in the past ten years than ever before. The protests, marches, and rallies have by no means gone away, but increasingly the organization and discussion of these events and issues has moved from the real world public to the digital public. In the past five years alone, tens if not *hundreds* of movements have started based on a hashtag, with supporters using the hashtag in their social media posts to show their support. Most if not all of the newer movements with significant name recognition leave predominantly digital footprints in their wake. But name recognition is not the same as translating efforts to outcomes. 

One of the earlier examples of activism performed primarily on a digital platform was the **Arab Spring** of late 2010 to 2011.
